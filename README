I'm working my way through Ken Steiglitz' A Digital Signal Processing
Primer, and I wanted some practise to go with the theory.

To use these plugins, first you'll need to install LADSPA from
here: http://www.ladspa.org/. Then you need to compile the plugins
(I might create a makefile in the future). On my system (Ubuntu 10.10)
this works:

gcc -shared -fPIC -lm -O4 -o PLUGIN_NAME.so -ldl -Wall PLUGIN_NAME.c

Then, move them to the ladspa plugins directory. On Ubuntu this is
/usr/lib/ladspa/. Now programs like Audacity should recognise the
new plugins automatically.

Writing LADSPA plugins is dead easy, and it's quite fun. Give it a go!
